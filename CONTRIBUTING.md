# Contributing to RoK Vision

First of all, thank you for your interest in the project! 🛡️

### Current Project Status: Initial Development (v0.2.x)
The project is currently in a high-intensity development phase. I am working on the core architecture and fundamental features listed in the [ROADMAP.md].

**Important:** At this stage, I am **not accepting Pull Requests (PRs)** for new features or major refactors. This is to avoid code conflicts while the base structure is still evolving rapidly.

### How you can help right now:
Even though code contributions are closed for a while, you can still help a lot:
1. **Bug Reports:** If you find a bug, please open an [Issue].
2. **Feature Suggestions:** Have an idea for the War Reports or Alliance Stats? Let's discuss it in the Issues!
3. **Feedback:** Tell me how the API is performing on your specific hardware.

### When will PRs be open?
Once we reach a more stable version (v0.5.0+), I will update this file with guidelines for code contributions.

Thank you for understanding!
